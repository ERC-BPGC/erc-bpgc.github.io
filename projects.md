					<h3>Trotbot</h3>
				</header>
				<p><strong>Team Lead: Siddh Gosar</strong><br>
				Trotbot is a multipurpose omni-directional robot, designed to serve autonomously in indoor/semi-indoor environments. It can be used to deliver packages from one location to another in offices, construction sites, buildings etc.
				It can also be teleoperated to nearby locations using the camera feed for surveillance and mapping.
				The robot will be able to autonomously navigate around obstacles and reach waypoints set in and around the environment with the use of onboard sensors and be able to detect it's location.
				Currently, we are looking at visual inertial odometry for robust localization in indoor environments.

					<h3>SpiderBot</h3>
				</header>
				<p><strong>Team Lead: Laukik Nakhwa</strong><br>
				Project SpiderBot aims to develop a six-legged round body Hexapod. Hexapods are a very versatile legged option since they provide more passive stability during locomotion as compared to a quadruped. They also benefit from a lower impact on the terrain and have greater mobility in surroundings.<br>
				The major goal of this project is to study and develop walking gaits, trajectories and controllers for the robot to traverse any kind of terrain in an optimum manner. This will also include creating a more robust and reliable design for a hexapod.

					<h3>EchoSLAM</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Team Lead: Tanmay Bhonsale <br>
				EchoSLAM is based on the idea of using sound waves to localise a team of robots and help them navigate their environment. It is inspired by previous work like Millibots and MaxelBot, but seeks to extend their functionality by implementing Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). The system proposed is potentially cheaper, more compact, and less computationally intensive than alternatives like RADAR, LiDAR etc, thus enabling the creation of large, coordinating, decentralised robots in an economical manner.

					<h3>Acoustic Camera</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Team Leads: Tanay Patni and Sahil Shingote <br>
				An acoustic camera is an imaging device used to locate sound sources. It uses multiple microphones and advanced acoustic signal processing algorithms to accomplish this task. Our goal is to create a low-cost acoustic camera that could be used in applications such as noise reduction in machinery and aerodynamic surfaces

				<p><strong>Team Leads: Ishan Tandon | Yash Chavan</strong> <br>
				This project aims to design and manufacture a robust robotic arm integrated with a reliable perception and control system that will enable it to perform simple as well as intelligent tasks with high precision and repeatability.<br>
				The immediate aim of the project is to design and assemble a five-degree of freedom (DOF) robotic arm with forwarding and inverse kinematic control. Along with the capability of autonomous operation and object detection, which as a whole allows it to perform pick and place operations on objects within the workspace, including playing chess against human players.

					<h3>SwarmBots 2.0</h3>
				</header>
				<p><strong>Team Leads: Dhruv Potdar | Manan Arora</strong> <br>
				Swarm robotics is an approach to the coordinated behaviour of multi-robot systems. A swarm robotic system comprises a group of simple robots equipped with basic algorithms, sensors, and actuators. However, these bots are collectively able to carry out complex tasks.<br>
				The project aims to build a decentralised swarm of autonomous mobile robots and implement various ‘collective decision-making’ algorithms on this swarm. The project will serve as a platform for various swarm-robotics-related applications in the future. It is intended that upon receiving a set of parameters from a user, the swarm can be modified and deployed to assist in various tasks. The project is a continuation of the work done by our seniors on hardware.

					<h3>Carborone</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Team Lead: Vinay Sabarad <br>
				This project aims to Create a model of Autonomous drone car. Which can analyse the environment and take decisions using OpenCV and decide whether to move on the ground or fly to avoid an obstacle and decide its own trajectory . It’s main aim is to improve the applications of a car on the ground so that it could  travel to even the most difficult places than it would be possible for a normal car. We also aim to have a power efficient version of drone car that can fly for longer durations and make it more accessible by safely going to different locations.

					<h3>Ball-Drone</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Team Lead: Cheriyan Homey <br>
				Ball drone is a ‘uni-rotor’ VTOL drone that is maneuvered using four control surfaces. The drone is capable of performing all the tasks done by a conventional quadcopter using less power. The spherical shell also helps in protecting the inner hardware and rotating propeller from any immediate threat. . The spherical shell will be 3D printed and the flight controller will be made with an ESP32 microcontroller and a MPU 9250. A CAD model and a simulator of the drone on Simscape multibody is made.

					<h3>GenNav</h3>
				</header>
				<p><strong>Team Lead: Atharv Sonwane</strong> <br>
				Gennav aims to create a general purpose python library that can be used for path planning in various robotics settings. It will have a collection of path planning algorithms, motion controllers along with various utilities to handle different methods of path optimisation, environment representation and eventually a geometry module to handle the underlying computations. Currently focused on the 2D path planning aspect of navigation.Rather than writing a big new python file for each new path planning algorithm, we could build on already defined utilities and primitives. This would be a big help to anyone working on any robot with autonomous navigation capabilities in the future. All they would need to do is implement the robot specific code and use gennav for the planning, control and optimization heavy lifting.

					<h3>Quadruped <i>a.k.a. Bhaagwati</i></h3>
				</header>
				<p><strong>Team Lead: Mohit Gupta</strong><br>
				The main objective is to mimic a four legged animal and get various gaits out of it like trot, bound, canter through open loop and closed loop methods. It will be further used as a platform for attachment of vision based system for mapping different terrains
				We have successfully deployed trotting walk on the quadruped. A ROS(Robot Operating System) package is also created. A static self-stabilizing PID controller using an IMU has been created and successfully deployed on the quadruped.
				Different gaits will be tested on the quadruped. A dynamic stabilizing strategy will be developed. Later, environment tracking using realsense depth camera will be developed.

					<h3>Modbot</h3>
				</header>
				<p><strong>Team Lead: Prathmesh Thorwe</strong> <br>
				Modular Robots are a system of individual modules capable of linking to each other to form reconfigurable structures suited for different purposes. Using this method, a single system can be used for a wide range of applications. This is useful when the task/environment of a bot is not known beforehand.
				The project aimed to design, simulate and manufacture such modules with maximum DOFs possible for a highly flexible and robust system. A single module was manufactured capable of teleoperation. An Arduino Nano and an ESP32 were used to control the input to the respective motors.

The bots do not communicate with each other, and perform tasks through 'collective decision making' algorithms.
				Multiple simulations have been created to perform tasks such as line formation, circle formation, etc. Along with this evaluation metrics were attached to each task to monitor the quality.

					<h3>LED Globe</h3>

				<p>Team Lead: Mohit Gupta <br>
				LED Globe was the flagship display project from ERC for Quark 2019, the technical fest of BITS-Goa.
				The globe consisted of two 75 cm radius acrylic semicircular discs having LEDs along the perimeter of one of them. This setup was mounted vertically on an aluminium frame. The setup would be rotated using a high torque motor. The synchronised firing of LEDs created the illusion of an image.
				The programming that was involved allowed one to take any image from the internet, divide it into a number of segments which the code could recognize and thus program the LEDs in that manner.
